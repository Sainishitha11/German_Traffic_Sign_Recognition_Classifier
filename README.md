# German_Traffic_Sign_Recognition_Classifier
This project presents an effective solution to the Traffic Sign Classification problem using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The model is trained to accurately recognize and classify different traffic signs from image data, achieving strong generalization.
## Highlights
- **Model:** LeNet-based CNN  
- **Training Accuracy:** **99.8%**  
- **Epochs:** 50  
- **Input Size:** 32×32 grayscale images  
- **Saved Model:** `lenet`

## Key Techniques
- Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping)  
- Normalization and grayscale conversion  
- CNN training and inference on new images  

## Applications
Autonomous vehicles, ADAS systems, and intelligent traffic monitoring.
